    Dev Tools
    Console Logging
    Variables: var, const, let
    Data Types
    This Keyword and Operators/Spread
    Decision Making: Arrow Functions, Switch, Error Handling
    Ternary Operator
    JavaSript OOP: Class, Method, Instantiating, Inheritence
    Flexbox
    Bootstrap
    Interacting with the DOM
    Regex

After learning these concepts, I was challenged to create a personal website with the following:

    Header with desired job title
    Image of myself
    Clickable github icon linking to github page
    Clickable LinkedIn icon linking to LinkedIn page
    List of tech related skills
    Dynamically listed Github repo
    Sticky footer
    Styled with plain CSS
